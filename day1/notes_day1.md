Operators are specaila symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.

*The Operators*

+, -, *, /, and ** (exponentiation)

// (integer) division

## **2.6 Expressions**

An expression is a conmbination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions, assuming they have an assigned value.

follow PEMDAS

## **2.8 Modulus Operator**

The modulus operator works on integers and yields the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second.

## **2.9 String Operations**

The + operator works with strings, but it is not addition in the mathematical sense. instead it performs ***concatenation,*** *which means joining the strings by linking them end to end.*

The * operator also works with strings by multiplying the content of a string by an integer.

"""1. Why float() Sometimes Appears and Sometimes Doesn't

*   List item
*   List item



When you assing values directly - hours = 35, rate = 12.5 - those are already numbers. Python knows to multiply them.

When you use input(), the system always stores the responses as text, not as number. "39" is not 39. That's why you must convert to float() or int() before using it in math. That is not optional. it is the rule.

2. Your Gross Pay Script

it functions, but the presentaion is sloppy. Workers should have pride in clean work. Use f-strings for neat output, and format currency properly.

See corrected version.

"""3. The Experiment You Should Run

Check types explicitly. The system will tell you exactly what you're dealing with:

"""

print(type(x))    # str

"""This is not busywork. This is how you confirm your assumptions.

Q1. Types

Write code that:



*   Creates a variable x with the value "42" (string)
*   Creates a variable y with the value 42 (integer)


*   Prints the type of each variable
*   Explains in a comment why the types differ.





Variables created correctly, types printed clearly, comment accurately explains string vs int.
"""

# Q1. Types

x = "42"
print(type(x))      # str
y = 42
print(type(y))      # int

# The types differ because when we use values directly - y = 42, those are already numbers and python knows to multiply them.
# However, when we use input() python stores the response as text, not as a number and reads them as a string.

"""Q2. Arithmetic Expressions

Write code that:


*   Creates two variables, a = 17, and b = 3
*   Prints the result of each of the following expressions, with labels:


*   a + b
*   a - b

*   a * b
*   a / b

*   a // b
*   a % b



*   Add a comment explaining the difference between / and //

# / this represents true division, results will always be floating - point number.
# // this represent floor division, returns largest integer less than or equal to the result.
# // in other words, it rounds down answer towards negative infinity.

"""Q3. User Input and Conversion

*   Prompt the user for two numbers
*   Prints their product


*   Show what happens if you don't use float() or int() for conversions
*   Correct the error by converting properly.

*   f"string is just a normal string that starts with the letter f (or F) before the opening quote.
*   Inside it, you can insert variables or even calculations inside {}, and Python will fill them in automatically.

*   f"hello {name}: You're telling python: Replace anything inside {} with the value of that variable or expression.
*   String Interpolation: you're weaving variables inside a sentence.




"""

# Example 1: Simple Variable Insertion

name = "Danae"
language = "Python"
print(f"Hello {name}, welcome to {language} class!")

# How it works
# The string begins with f.
#{name} becomes "Danae"
#{language} becomes "Python"

# Example 2: Doing math inside an f-String

age = 32
print(f"in 5 years, you will be {age + 5} years old.")

# Inside the braces {}, Python evaluates the expression age + 5.
# It doesn't just print the text, it actually calculates.

# Example 3: Changing Text with String Methods

name = "helena eagen"
print(f"{name.title()} always expects excellence.")

# .title() capitalizes each word.

#Example 4: Formatting Numbers (Money, Decimals)

price = 9.4567
print(f"The total is ${price:.2f}")

# :.2f means "format as a float with 2 decimal places"

pi = 3.14159265
print(f"π rounded to 3 decimals is {pi:.3f}")

# :.3f means "format as a float with 3 decimal places"

# Example 5: Using f-Strings for Multiple Variables

city = "San Diego"
temp = 72
condition = "sunny"
print(f"Today in {city}, it is {temp}° and {condition}.")

# Example 6: Combining input + f-Strings

name = input("Enter your name: ")
hobby = input("What do you love doing? ")
print(f"{name}, that's awesome! Keep enoying {hobby.lower()}.")

# .lower() means lowercase the word.

# Example 7: Inline Calculations or Functions

import math
radius = 5
print(f"The area of a circle with a {radius} is {math.pi * radius ** 2:.2f}.")

"""# **When to Use F-Strings**"""

# Use f-strings when...
# You are interpolating variables or expressions into a string.

name = "Danae"
age = 32
print (f"{name} will be {age + 1} next year.")

# You want formatted output (rounding, padding, alignment, currency).

pi = 3.14159
print (f"Pi rounded to 2 decimals: {pi:.2f}")

# The string contains both text and values, making concatenation messy.

hours, rate = 39, 29.90
print(f"Hours: {hours}, Rate: ${rate:.2f}")

"""# **When NOT to Use F-Strings**

"""

# Don't use f-strings when...
# You're just printing a variable by itself.

x = "Data"
print(x)    # simple, clear
print (f"{x}")  # redundant, no benefit

# You're combining only static strings.

print("Data" + "Science")   # fine
print(f"Data Science")      # unnecessary, no variables

"""**Think of it like this:**


*   If the string is dynamic (depends on variables, math, formatting) -> **f-string**.
*   If the string is static or trivial -> plain string/concatenation is cleaner.

Use the simplest tool that expresses intent clearly. No adornments. f-strings are a scalpel, not a hammer.

"""

# Single variable only
print(f"{x}")  # XX
# Avoid f-string, just write plain strings.
print(x)

# Static text only
print(f"Data Science")  # XX
# Avoid f-string, no variables; f-string is redundant

"""# **F- String VS. Plain Strings**

*  **Single Variable only** - print(f"{x}") - ❌ Avoid
Adds no value; just write print(x)

*   **Static text only** - print(f"Data Science") - ❌ Avoid
No variables; f-string is redundant


*   **Concatenating two string variables** - print(f"{x} {y}") VS. print(x + " " + Y) - ✅ Either
Both are clear; choose one style and be consistent


*   **String repetition** - print("Data" * 3) - ✅ Plain
Repetition is a language feature; f-string adds clutter


*   **Sentence with variables** - print(f"{name} will be {age} next year.") - ✅ F-string
Cleanest way to embed variables in text


*  **Numeric formatting**- print(f"{pi:.2f}")- ✅ F-string
Allows formatting directly in the string


*   **Mix of text + calculation** - print(f"Gross pay: ${hours * rate:.2f}") - ✅ F-string
Combines expression + formatting neatly


*   **Debug printing** - print(f"x={x}, y={y}, total={x + y}") - ✅ F-string
Fastest way to show multiple values clearly
