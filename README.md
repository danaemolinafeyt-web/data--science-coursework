# Python Basics — Data Science Track

This repository contains my Python practice, drills, and mini-projects as I build foundations for data analysis and machine learning.

## Structure
- `day1/` — Day 1 quiz (types, input, expressions) and notes.
- `drills/` — Short practice scripts (f-strings, input conversion).
